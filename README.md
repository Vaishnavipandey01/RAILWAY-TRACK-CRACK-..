# RAILWAY-TRACK-CRACK-..
Project Description:
This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting cracks and defects in railway tracks using a Raspberry Pi 4. The system uses computer vision techniques to analyze images captured by a camera mounted on a moving train or trackside camera, identifying cracks, deformations, or other potential issues. This system can be deployed for real-time monitoring of railway tracks, helping in maintenance and ensuring safety.
Key Features:
*Crack Detection: Detects visible cracks or deformations in the railway tracks.
*Image Capture: Uses a Raspberry Pi Camera Module or external USB camera to capture track images.
*Real-time Processing: Processes images using Python and OpenCV for immediate analysis.
*Machine Learning: Optionally, a deep learning model (e.g., CNN) can be employed for more accurate crack detection.
*Alert System: Sends notifications (email/SMS) upon detecting significant cracks or track deformations.
*Edge Detection Algorithms: Uses image processing techniques like Canny edge detection to highlight track cracks.
Hardware Requirements:
*Raspberry Pi 4 (with Raspberry Pi OS installed)
*Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 or USB camera
*MicroSD Card (for Raspberry Pi OS and project code)
*Power Supply (for Raspberry Pi and peripherals)
*Optional: External storage or cloud service for storing images and logs
Software Requirements:
*Raspberry Pi OS (or another compatible Linux-based OS)
*Python 3
*OpenCV (for image processing tasks)
*TensorFlow or PyTorch (optional, for deep learning-based crack detection)
*Email/SMS libraries (for sending alerts)
Installation Guide:
(1)Set Up Raspberry Pi:Install Raspberry Pi OS on a microSD card and boot the Raspberry Pi 4.
Connect a Raspberry Pi Camera Module or USB camera to the Raspberry Pi.
(2)Install Required Software:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-opencv python3-picamera
pip install tensorflow # if using deep learning
(3)Clone Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/railway-track-crack-detection.git
cd railway-track-crack-detection
(4)Run the Crack Detection Script:
python3 detect_cracks.py
(5)Set Up Alert System: To enable SMS or email alerts upon crack detection, configure the alert system in the alerts.py script with your preferred method (e.g., Twilio for SMS, SMTP for email).

Usage:
*Capture Images: Mount the camera at a fixed position to capture images of the railway tracks at regular intervals.
*Detect Cracks: The system processes each image to detect cracks or defects.
*Alert: When a crack is detected, an email or SMS alert is sent.
*Maintenance: Analyze logs to identify where cracks or issues are most frequent, enabling proactive maintenance
Contributing:
*Improving crack detection accuracy
*Enhancing real-time performance
*Adding new alerting methods
